Keith,

below I have included a short C program which I think illustrates a bug
with DB 1.85. 

Basically seq doesn't seem to like values >= 56K when you are using the
hash format (btree seems to be ok). On my Sun the program below will
print

    using seq
    3 => 20
    4 => 55
    EOF/Error, stat = -1, 22
    
    using get
    5 => 57344
    done
    
As you can see it has failed to retrieve the 56K record using seq, but
can get it using get.

Assuming this is actually a bug, what are the chances of a quick(ish) patch
for this problem (given that I know you are working on a major upgrade
to DB already)?

Paul

DESCRIPTION
-----------

DB_File is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the
facilities provided by Berkeley DB.  

Berkeley DB is a C library which provides a consistent interface to a
number of database formats. DB_File provides an interface to all three
of the database types (hash, btree and recno) currently supported by
Berkeley DB.

For further details see the pod documentation embedded in the file
DB_File.pm.

PREREQUISITES
-------------

Before you can build DB_File you need to have the following installed
on your system:

    * Perl 5.003 or better. 
    * Berkeley DB. 

      Berkeley DB is available at your nearest CPAN archive (see
      the section on CPAN in the perlmod manpage for a list) in
      src/misc/db.1.85.tar.gz, or via the host ftp.cs.berkeley.edu in
      /ucb/4bsd/db.tar.gz.  Alternatively, check out the Berkeley DB
      home page at http://www.bostic.com/db. It is not under the GPL.

      If you are running IRIX, then get Berkeley DB from
      http://reality.sgi.com/ariel. It has the patches necessary to
      compile properly on IRIX 5.3.


BUILDING THE MODULE
-------------------

Assuming you have met all the prerequisites, building the module should
be relatively straightforward.

The first step is to edit the file CONFIG to suit you local
installation. Instructions are given in the file.

The module can now be built and tested using this sequence of
commands:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test

INSTALLATION
------------

    make install

How to report a problem with DB_File.

To help me help you, I need of the following information:

 1. the version of Perl and the operating system name and version you
    are running. If you are running a newish version of Perl, the
    output from running "perl -V" will tell me all I need to know. 
    If your perl doesn't understand the -V flag, then not only do you
    have quite an old version of Perl, you very likely have an old
    version of DB_File.  You should consider upgrading. The problem you
    have might already be fixed.

 2. the version of DB_File you have. This one-liner will tell you:

       perl -e 'use DB_File; print "DB_File ver $DB_File::VERSION\n"'

    The most recent version of DB_File is 1.07.

 3. the version of Berkeley DB you have installed. The most recent
    version is 1.85. Again, if you have an older version, think about
    upgrading (the DB_File documentation tells you where to find it).

 4. now the difficult one. To *greatly* enhance the chances of me
    being able to track down a bug, I need a small self-contained Perl
    script that will illustrate the problem you are encountering, along
    some idea of what you think is wrong. Post a log of what happens
    when you run the script, in case I can't reproduce your problem on
    my system. If possible, don't have the script dependent on an
    existing 20Meg database. If your script can create the database
    itself then that is preferred.

    I realise that in some cases this is easier said than done, so if
    you can only reproduce the problem in your existing script, then
    you can post me that if you want. Just don't expect me to find your
    problem in a hurry, or at all. :-)

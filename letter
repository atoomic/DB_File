Here is a patch for DB_File

Changes since 1.03:
 
  Minor documentation changes.
 
  Included Dave Hammen's fix for hash_cb.
 
  Fixed a bug with the constructors for DB_File::HASHINFO,
  DB_File::BTREEINFO and DB_File::RECNOINFO. Also tidied up the
  constructors to make them -w clean.
 
  Reworked part of the test harness to be more locale friendly.

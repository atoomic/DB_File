=head2 Non-Unix ports of DB_File

The only non-Unix port of DB_File that was available when this document
was written is for OS/2. For more details, check out the file
F<README.os2> in the Perl source top-level directory.

Although there aren't any native NT, Windows 3.x and Windows 95 ports of
DB_File, you can make use of the OS/2 port as long as they have EMX
installed. Again check out the F<README.os2> file for further details.

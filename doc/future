I have been putting off the wholesale reorganisation of the DB_File
interface till version 2 of Berkeley DB arrived. Given that it has been
coming "some time soon" for about 2 years I though I'd bit the bullet
and do it anyway.

DB_File as it currently stands is really 3 database interfaces (hash,
btree and recno) all rolled into 1 package. The choice of which one
gets used is controlled by a "typed parameter". When I wrote it that
way it did seem like a good idea, but I now feel it is clumbsy.

Proposal: keep the current interface to keep existing code happy.

Create 3 new base classes BerkDB::Hash BerkDB::Btree and BerkDB::Recno.

An additional 3 classes DB_File2::Hash etc will be sub-classed off the
base classes.

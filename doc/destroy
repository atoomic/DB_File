There is a fairly obscure wrinkle you should be aware of when using the
strict untie pragma. It only affects calls to untie that are made
inside an object destructor (i.e. a DESTROY method).

Consider this code:

When run, it produces this output:

The workaround for this is to change the fatal into warnings using
$SIG{__DIE__}.

If this piece of code is added to the original code abo

    $SIG{__DIE__} = sub {} ;

Now when the program is run the calls to B<die>

How to report a problem with DB_File.


To help me help you, I need of the following information:

  * the version of Perl and the operating system name and version you
    are running. If you are running a newish version of Perl, the
    output from running "perl -V" will tell me all I need to know. If
    your perl doesn't understand the -V flag, then not only do you have
    quite an old version of Perl, you very likely have an old version
    of DB_File.  You should consider upgrading. The problem you have
    might already be fixed.

  * the version of DB_File you have. This one-liner will tell you:

       perl -e 'use DB_File; print "DB_File ver $DB_File::VERSION\n"'

    The most recent version of DB_File is 1.04, it ships with Perl
    5.003_08.

  * the version of Berkeley DB you have installed. The most recent
    version is 1.85. Again, if you have an older version, think about
    upgrading (the DB_File documentation tells you where to find it).

  * now the difficult one. To *greatly* enhance the chances of me
    being able to track down a bug, I need a small self-contained Perl
    script that will illustrate the problem you are encountering, along
    some idea of what you think is wrong. Post a log of what happens
    when you run the script, in case I can't reproduce your problem on
    my system. If possible, don't have the script dependent on an
    existing 20Meg database. If your script can create the database
    itself then that is preferred.

    I realise that in some cases this is easier said than done, so if
    you can only reproduce the problem in your existing script, then
    you can post me that if you want. Be aware though, I maintain
    DB_File in my spare time.



Things not to do:

   * post fragments of code

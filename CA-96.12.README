Issue date: June 26, 1996

Revision history:
  June 27, 1996			Added information for NEC.
  June 26, 1996			Added information for Digital Equipment.


This file is a supplement to CERT advisory CA-96.12, "Vulnerability in
suidperl." We update this file as additional information becomes
available. If you have any questions about vendor information,
please contact the vendor directly.

Note: We recommend checking with your vendor for current MD5 checksum values.
      After we publish checksums in advisories and READMEs, the checksums may
      become obsolete because the files they refer to have been updated.


The text below the dotted line originally appeared as Appendix A in the

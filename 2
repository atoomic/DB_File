In case anyone is interested, Keith Bostic has placed the first draft
of the Berkeley DB 2.0 manual pages on the Berkeley DB home page. He
has requested comments on the new functionality, the quality of the
documentation, etc.

Check out:

As a taster, here are some of the cool new features:

    * internal support for locking.
    * transactions with rollback.
    * multiple cursors
    * partial record retrieval
    
DB_File will be reworked to support as many of the new features as
possible.

DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
<STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the
facilities provided by Berkeley DB.  If you intend to use this
module you should really have a copy of the Berkeley DB manual pages at
hand. The interface defined here mirrors the Berkeley DB interface
closely.
<p>Berkeley DB is a C library which provides a consistent interface to a
number of database formats.  <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> provides an interface to all
three of the database types currently supported by Berkeley DB.
<p>The file types are:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="DB_File.pm_db_hash_1">
DB_HASH</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This database type allows arbitrary key/value pairs to be stored in data
files. This is equivalent to the functionality provided by other
hashing packages like DBM, NDBM, ODBM, GDBM, and SDBM. Remember though,
the files created using DB_HASH are not compatible with any of the
other packages mentioned.
<p>A default hashing algorithm, which will be adequate for most
applications, is built into Berkeley DB. If you do need to use your own
hashing algorithm it is possible to write your own in Perl and have
<STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> use it instead.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="DB_File.pm_db_btree_1">
DB_BTREE</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The btree format allows arbitrary key/value pairs to be stored in a
sorted, balanced binary tree.
<p>As with the DB_HASH format, it is possible to provide a user defined
Perl routine to perform the comparison of keys. By default, though, the
keys are stored in lexical order.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="DB_File.pm_db_recno_1">
DB_RECNO</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
DB_RECNO allows both fixed-length and variable-length flat text files
to be manipulated using the same key/value pair interface as in DB_HASH
and DB_BTREE.  In this case the key will consist of a record (line)
number.
<p>
</DL>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="DB_File.pm_how_0">
How does DB_File interface to Berkeley DB?</A>
</H2>
<STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> allows access to Berkeley DB files using the <EM>tie()</EM> mechanism
in Perl 5 (for full details, see <EM>tie</EM>). This facility
allows <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> to access Berkeley DB files using either an
associative array (for DB_HASH &amp; DB_BTREE file types) or an ordinary
array (for the DB_RECNO file type).
<p>In addition to the <EM>tie()</EM> interface, it is also possible to access most
of the functions provided in the Berkeley DB API directly.
See 
<A HREF="DB.html#DB_File.pm_the_1"><EM>THE API INTERFACE</EM></A>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="DB_File.pm_opening_0">
Opening a Berkeley DB Database File</A>
</H2>
Berkeley DB uses the function <EM>dbopen()</EM> to open or create a database.
Here is the C prototype for <EM>dbopen()</EM>:
<p>
<XMP>
      DB*
      dbopen (const char * file, int flags, int mode, 
              DBTYPE type, const void * openinfo)

</XMP>
<p>The parameter <CODE>type</CODE> is an enumeration which specifies which of the 3
interface methods (DB_HASH, DB_BTREE or DB_RECNO) is to be used.
Depending on which of these is actually chosen, the final parameter,
<EM>openinfo</EM> points to a data structure which allows tailoring of the
specific interface method.
<p>This interface is handled slightly differently in <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG>. Here is
an equivalent call using <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG>:
<p>
<XMP>
        tie %array, 'DB_File', $filename, $flags, $mode, $DB_HASH ;

</XMP>
<p>The <CODE>filename</CODE>, <CODE>flags</CODE> and <CODE>mode</CODE> parameters are the direct
equivalent of their <EM>dbopen()</EM> counterparts. The final parameter <STRONG>$DB_HASH</STRONG>
performs the function of both the <CODE>type</CODE> and <CODE>openinfo</CODE> parameters in
<EM>dbopen()</EM>.
<p>In the example above <STRONG>$DB_HASH</STRONG> is actually a pre-defined reference to a
hash object. <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> has three of these pre-defined references.
Apart from <STRONG>$DB_HASH</STRONG>, there is also <STRONG>$DB_BTREE</STRONG> and <STRONG>$DB_RECNO</STRONG>.
<p>The keys allowed in each of these pre-defined references is limited to
the names used in the equivalent C structure. So, for example, the
<STRONG>$DB_HASH</STRONG> reference will only allow keys called <CODE>bsize</CODE>, <CODE>cachesize</CODE>,
<CODE>ffactor</CODE>, <CODE>hash</CODE>, <CODE>lorder</CODE> and <CODE>nelem</CODE>. 
<p>To change one of these elements, just assign to it like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        $DB_HASH->{'cachesize'} = 10000 ;

</XMP>
<p>The three predefined variables <STRONG>$DB_HASH</STRONG>, <STRONG>$DB_BTREE</STRONG> and <STRONG>$DB_RECNO</STRONG> are
usually adequate for most applications.  If you do need to create extra
instances of these objects, constructors are available for each file
type.
<p>Here are examples of the constructors and the valid options available
for DB_HASH, DB_BTREE and DB_RECNO respectively.
<p>
<XMP>
     $a = new DB_File::HASHINFO ;
     $a->{'bsize'} ;
     $a->{'cachesize'} ;
     $a->{'ffactor'};
     $a->{'hash'} ;
     $a->{'lorder'} ;
     $a->{'nelem'} ;
     $b = new DB_File::BTREEINFO ;
     $b->{'flags'} ;
     $b->{'cachesize'} ;
     $b->{'maxkeypage'} ;
     $b->{'minkeypage'} ;
     $b->{'psize'} ;
     $b->{'compare'} ;
     $b->{'prefix'} ;
     $b->{'lorder'} ;
     $c = new DB_File::RECNOINFO ;
     $c->{'bval'} ;
     $c->{'cachesize'} ;
     $c->{'psize'} ;
     $c->{'flags'} ;
     $c->{'lorder'} ;
     $c->{'reclen'} ;
     $c->{'bfname'} ;

</XMP>
<p>The values stored in the hashes above are mostly the direct equivalent
of their C counterpart. Like their C counterparts, all are set to a
default values - that means you don't have to set <EM>all</EM> of the
values when you only want to change one. Here is an example:
<p>
<XMP>
     $a = new DB_File::HASHINFO ;
     $a->{'cachesize'} =  12345 ;
     tie %y, 'DB_File', "filename", $flags, 0777, $a ;

</XMP>
<p>A few of the values need extra discussion here. When used, the C
equivalent of the keys <CODE>hash</CODE>, <CODE>compare</CODE> and <CODE>prefix</CODE> store pointers
to C functions. In <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> these keys are used to store references
to Perl subs. Below are templates for each of the subs:
<p>
<XMP>
    sub hash
    {
        my ($data) = @_ ;
        ...
        # return the hash value for $data
        return $hash ;
    }
    sub compare
    {
        my ($key, $key2) = @_ ;
        ...
        # return  0 if $key1 eq $key2
        #        -1 if $key1 lt $key2
        #         1 if $key1 gt $key2
        return (-1 , 0 or 1) ;
    }
    sub prefix
    {
        my ($key, $key2) = @_ ;
        ...
        # return number of bytes of $key2 which are 
        # necessary to determine that it is greater than $key1
        return $bytes ;
    }

</XMP>
<p>See 
<A HREF="DB.html#DB_File.pm_changing_0"><EM>Changing the BTREE sort order</EM></A>
 for an example of using the
<CODE>compare</CODE> template.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="DB_File.pm_default_0">
Default Parameters</A>
</H2>
It is possible to omit some or all of the final 4 parameters in the
call to <CODE>tie</CODE> and let them take default values. As DB_HASH is the most
common file format used, the call:
<p>
<XMP>
    tie %A, "DB_File", "filename" ;

</XMP>
<p>is equivalent to:
<p>
<XMP>
    tie %A, "DB_File", "filename", O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0640, $DB_HASH ;

</XMP>
<p>It is also possible to omit the filename parameter as well, so the
call:
<p>
<XMP>
    tie %A, "DB_File" ;

</XMP>
<p>is equivalent to:
<p>
<XMP>
    tie %A, "DB_File", undef, O_CREAT|O_RDWR, 0640, $DB_HASH ;

</XMP>
<p>See 
<A HREF="DB.html#DB_File.pm_in_0"><EM>In Memory Databases</EM></A>
 for a discussion on the use of <CODE>undef</CODE>
in place of a filename.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="DB_File.pm_in_0">
In Memory Databases</A>
</H2>
Berkeley DB allows the creation of in-memory databases by using NULL
(that is, a <CODE>(char *)0</CODE> in C) in place of the filename.  <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG>
uses <CODE>undef</CODE> instead of NULL to provide this functionality.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="DB_File.pm_db_hash_1">
DB_HASH</A>
</H1>
The DB_HASH file format is probably the most commonly used of the three
file formats that <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> supports. It is also very straightforward
to use.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="DB_File.pm_a_0">
A Simple Example.</A>
</H2>
This example shows how to create a database, add key/value pairs to the
database, delete keys/value pairs and finally how to enumerate the
contents of the database.
<p>
<XMP>
    use DB_File ;
    use strict 'untie' ;
    tie %h, "DB_File", "fruit", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0640, $DB_HASH 
        or die "Cannot open file 'fruit': $!\n";
    # Add a few key/value pairs to the file
    $h{"apple"} = "red" ;
    $h{"orange"} = "orange" ;
    $h{"banana"} = "yellow" ;
    $h{"tomato"} = "red" ;
    # Check for existence of a key
    print "Banana Exists\n\n" if $h{"banana"} ;
    # Delete a key/value pair.
    delete $h{"apple"} ;
    # print the contents of the file
    while (($k, $v) = each %h)
      { print "$k -> $v\n" }
    untie %h ;

</XMP>
<p>here is the output:
<p>
<XMP>
    Banana Exists
 
    orange -> orange
    tomato -> red
    banana -> yellow

</XMP>
<p>Note that the like ordinary associative arrays, the order of the keys
retrieved is in an apparently random order.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="DB_File.pm_db_btree_1">
DB_BTREE</A>
</H1>
The DB_BTREE format is useful when you want to store data in a given
order. By default the keys will be stored in lexical order, but as you
will see from the example shown in the next section, it is very easy to
define your own sorting function.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="DB_File.pm_changing_0">
Changing the BTREE sort order</A>
</H2>
This script shows how to override the default sorting algorithm that
BTREE uses. Instead of using the normal lexical ordering, a case
insensitive compare function will be used.
<p>
<XMP>
    use DB_File ;
    use strict 'untie' ;
    sub Compare
    {
        my ($key1, $key2) = @_ ;
        "\L$key1" cmp "\L$key2" ;
    }
    # specify the Perl sub that will do the comparison
    $DB_BTREE->{'compare'} = \&Compare ;
    tie %h, "DB_File", "tree", O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0640, $DB_BTREE 
        or die "Cannot open file 'tree': $!\n" ;
    # Add a key/value pair to the file
    $h{'Wall'} = 'Larry' ;
    $h{'Smith'} = 'John' ;
    $h{'mouse'} = 'mickey' ;
    $h{'duck'}  = 'donald' ;
    # Delete
    delete $h{"duck"} ;
    # Cycle through the keys printing them in order.
    # Note it is not necessary to sort the keys as
    # the btree will have kept them in order automatically.
    foreach (keys %h)
      { print "$_\n" }
    untie %h ;

</XMP>
<p>Here is the output from the code above.
<p>
<XMP>
    mouse
    Smith
    Wall

</XMP>
<p>There are a few point to bear in mind if you want to change the
ordering in a BTREE database:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>The new compare function must be specified when you create the database.
<p>
<LI>You cannot change the ordering once the database has been created. Thus
you must use the same compare function every time you access the
database.
<p>
</OL>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="DB_File.pm_handling_0">
Handling duplicate keys </A>
</H2>
The BTREE file type optionally allows a single key to be associated
with an arbitrary number of values. This option is enabled by setting
the flags element of <CODE><STRONG>$DB_BTREE</STRONG></CODE> to R_DUP when creating the database.
<p>There are some difficulties in using the tied hash interface if you
want to manipulate a BTREE database with duplicate keys. Consider this
code:
<p>
<XMP>
    use DB_File ;
    use strict 'untie' ;
 
    $filename = "tree" ;
    unlink $filename ;
 
    # Enable duplicate records
    $DB_BTREE->{'flags'} = R_DUP ;
 
    tie %h, "DB_File", $filename, O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0640, $DB_BTREE 
        or die "Cannot open $filename: $!\n";
 
    # Add some key/value pairs to the file
    $h{'Wall'} = 'Larry' ;
    $h{'Wall'} = 'Brick' ; # Note the duplicate key
    $h{'Wall'} = 'Brick' ; # Note the duplicate key and value
    $h{'Smith'} = 'John' ;
    $h{'mouse'} = 'mickey' ;
    # iterate through the associative array
    # and print each key/value pair.
    foreach (keys %h)
      { print "$_  -> $h{$_}\n" }
    untie %h ;

</XMP>
<p>Here is the output:
<p>
<XMP>
    Smith   -> John
    Wall    -> Larry
    Wall    -> Larry
    Wall    -> Larry
    mouse   -> mickey

</XMP>
<p>As you can see 3 records have been successfully created with key <CODE>Wall</CODE>
- the only thing is, when they are retrieved from the database they
<EM>seem</EM> to have the same value, namely <CODE>Larry</CODE>. The problem is caused
by the way that the associative array interface works. Basically, when
the associative array interface is used to fetch the value associated
with a given key, it will only ever retrieve the first value.
<p>Although it may not be immediately obvious from the code above, the
associative array interface can be used to write values with duplicate
keys, but it cannot be used to read them back from the database.
<p>The way to get around this problem is to use the Berkeley DB API method
called <CODE>seq</CODE>.  This method allows sequential access to key/value
pairs. See 
<A HREF="DB.html#DB_File.pm_the_1"><EM>THE API INTERFACE</EM></A>
 for details of both the <CODE>seq</CODE> method
and the API in general.
<p>Here is the script above rewritten using the <CODE>seq</CODE> API method.
<p>
<XMP>
    use DB_File ;
    use strict 'untie' ;
 
    $filename = "tree" ;
    unlink $filename ;
 
    # Enable duplicate records
    $DB_BTREE->{'flags'} = R_DUP ;
 
    $x = tie %h, "DB_File", $filename, O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0640, $DB_BTREE 
        or die "Cannot open $filename: $!\n";
 
    # Add some key/value pairs to the file
    $h{'Wall'} = 'Larry' ;
    $h{'Wall'} = 'Brick' ; # Note the duplicate key
    $h{'Wall'} = 'Brick' ; # Note the duplicate key and value
    $h{'Smith'} = 'John' ;
    $h{'mouse'} = 'mickey' ;
 
    # iterate through the btree using seq
    # and print each key/value pair.
    for ($status = $x->seq($key, $value, R_FIRST) ;
         $status == 0 ;
         $status = $x->seq($key, $value, R_NEXT) )
      {  print "$key -> $value\n" }
 
    undef $x ;
    untie %h ;

</XMP>
<p>that prints:
<p>
<XMP>
    Smith   -> John
    Wall    -> Brick
    Wall    -> Brick
    Wall    -> Larry
    mouse   -> mickey

</XMP>
<p>This time we have got all the key/value pairs, including the multiple
values associated with the key <CODE>Wall</CODE>.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="DB_File.pm_the_0">
The get_dup method.</A>
</H2>
<STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> comes with a utility method, called <CODE>get_dup</CODE>, to assist in
reading duplicate values from BTREE databases. The method can take the
following forms:
<p>
<XMP>
    $count = $x->get_dup($key) ;
    @list  = $x->get_dup($key) ;
    %list  = $x->get_dup($key, 1) ;

</XMP>
<p>In a scalar context the method returns the number of values associated
with the key, <CODE><STRONG>$key</STRONG></CODE>.
<p>In list context, it returns all the values which match <CODE><STRONG>$key</STRONG></CODE>. Note
that the values will be returned in an apparently random order.
<p>In list context, if the second parameter is present and evaluates TRUE,
the method returns an associative array. The keys of the associative
array correspond to the the values that matched in the BTREE and the
values of the array are a count of the number of times that particular
value occurred in the BTREE.
<p>So assuming the database created above, we can use <CODE>get_dup</CODE> like
this:
<p>
<XMP>
    $cnt  = $x->get_dup("Wall") ;
    print "Wall occurred $cnt times\n" ;
    %hash = $x->get_dup("Wall", 1) ;
    print "Larry is there\n" if $hash{'Larry'} ;
    print "There are $hash{'Brick'} Brick Walls\n" ;
    @list = $x->get_dup("Wall") ;
    print "Wall =>      [@list]\n" ;
    @list = $x->get_dup("Smith") ;
    print "Smith =>     [@list]\n" ;
 
    @list = $x->get_dup("Dog") ;
    print "Dog =>       [@list]\n" ;

</XMP>
<p>and it will print:
<p>
<XMP>
    Wall occurred 3 times
    Larry is there
    There are 2 Brick Walls
    Wall =>     [Brick Brick Larry]
    Smith =>    [John]
    Dog =>      []

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="DB_File.pm_matching_0">
Matching Partial Keys </A>
</H2>
The BTREE interface has a feature which allows partial keys to be
matched. This functionality is <EM>only</EM> available when the <CODE>seq</CODE> method
is used along with the R_CURSOR flag.
<p>
<XMP>
    $x->seq($key, $value, R_CURSOR) ;

</XMP>
<p>Here is the relevant quote from the dbopen man page where it defines
the use of the R_CURSOR flag with seq:
<p>
<XMP>
    Note, for the DB_BTREE access method, the returned key is not
    necessarily an exact match for the specified key. The returned key
    is the smallest key greater than or equal to the specified key,
    permitting partial key matches and range searches.

</XMP>
<p>In the example script below, the <CODE>match</CODE> sub uses this feature to find
and print the first matching key/value pair given a partial key.
<p>
<XMP>
    use DB_File ;
    use Fcntl ;
    use strict 'untie' ;
    sub match

    # Add some key/value pairs to the file
    $h{'mouse'} = 'mickey' ;

DB_RECNO provides an interface to flat text files. Both variable and
fixed length records are supported.
<p>In order to make RECNO more compatible with Perl the array offset for
all RECNO arrays begins at 0 rather than 1 as in Berkeley DB.
<p>As with normal Perl arrays, a RECNO array can be accessed using

-2 the second last, and so on. Attempting to access an element before

THE API INTERFACE</A>
</H1>
As well as accessing Berkeley DB using a tied hash or array, it is also
possible to make direct use of most of the API functions defined in the
Berkeley DB documentation.
<p>To do this you need to store a copy of the object returned from the tie.
<p>
<XMP>
        $db = tie %hash, "DB_File", "filename" ;

</XMP>
<p>Once you have done that, you can access the Berkeley DB API functions
as <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> methods directly like this:
<p>
<XMP>
        $db->put($key, $value, R_NOOVERWRITE) ;

</XMP>
<p><STRONG>Important:</STRONG> If you have saved a copy of the object returned from
<CODE>tie</CODE>, the underlying database file will <EM>not</EM> be closed until both
the tied variable is untied and all copies of the saved object are
destroyed. See 
<A HREF="DB.html#DB_File.pm_the_2"><EM>The strict untie pragma</EM></A>
 for more details.
<p>
<XMP>
    use DB_File ;
    $db = tie %hash, "DB_File", "filename" 
        or die "Cannot tie filename: $!" ;
    ...
    undef $db ;
    untie %hash ;

</XMP>
<p>All the functions defined in the <EM>dbopen</EM>  manpage
 are available except for
<EM>close()</EM> and <EM>dbopen()</EM> itself. The <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> method interface to the
supported functions have been implemented to mirror the way Berkeley DB
works whenever possible. In particular note that:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>The methods return a status value. All return 0 on success.
All return -1 to signify an error and set <CODE>$!</CODE> to the exact
error code. The return code 1 generally (but not always) means that the
key specified did not exist in the database.
<p>Other return codes are defined. See below and in the Berkeley DB
documentation for details. The Berkeley DB documentation should be used
as the definitive source.
<p>
<LI>Whenever a Berkeley DB function returns data via one of its parameters,
the equivalent <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> method does exactly the same.
<p>
<LI>If you are careful, it is possible to mix API calls with the tied
hash/array interface in the same piece of code. Although only a few of
the methods used to implement the tied interface currently make use of
the cursor, you should always assume that the cursor has been changed
any time the tied hash/array interface is used. As an example, this
code will probably not do what you expect:
<p>
<XMP>
    $X = tie %x, 'DB_File', $filename, O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0777, $DB_BTREE
        or die "Cannot tie $filename: $!" ;
    # Get the first key/value pair and set  the cursor
    $X->seq($key, $value, R_FIRST) ;
    # this line will modify the cursor
    $count = scalar keys %x ; 
    # Get the second key/value pair.
    # oops, it didn't, it got the last key/value pair!
    $X->seq($key, $value, R_NEXT) ;

</XMP>
<p>The code above can be rearranged to get around the problem, like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    $X = tie %x, 'DB_File', $filename, O_RDWR|O_CREAT, 0777, $DB_BTREE
        or die "Cannot tie $filename: $!" ;
    # this line will modify the cursor
    $count = scalar keys %x ; 
    # Get the first key/value pair and set  the cursor
    $X->seq($key, $value, R_FIRST) ;
    # Get the second key/value pair.
    # worked this time.
    $X->seq($key, $value, R_NEXT) ;

HINTS AND TIPS </A>

<A NAME="DB_File.pm_the_2">
The strict untie pragma</A>
</H2>
If you run Perl version 5.004 or later (actually any version from the
5.003_01 development release on will suffice) and you make use of the
Berkeley DB API, it is is <EM>very</EM> strongly recommended that you always
include the <CODE>use strict 'untie'</CODE> pragma in any of your scripts that
make use of <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG>.
<p>Even if you don't currently make use of the API interface, it is still
a good idea to include the pragma. It won't affect the performance of
your script, but it will prevent problems in the future.
<p>If possible you should try to run with the full strict pragma, but that
is another story. For further details see the <EM>strict</EM>  manpage
 and 
<EM>WHY YOU SHOULD ALWAYS <CODE>use strict</EM</CODE&gt;&gt;.
<p>To illustrate the importance of including the untie pragma, here is an
example script that fails in an unexpected place because it doesn't use
it:
<p>
<XMP>
    use DB_File ;
    use Fcntl ;
 
    $X = tie %x, 'DB_File', 'tst.fil' , O_RDWR|O_CREAT
        or die "Cannot tie first time: $!" ;
 
    $x{123} = 456 ;
 
    untie %x ;
 
    $X = tie %x, 'DB_File', 'tst.fil' , O_RDWR|O_CREAT
        or die "Cannot tie second time: $!" ;
    untie %x ;

</XMP>
<p>When run the script will produce this error message:
<p>
<XMP>
    Cannot tie second time: Invalid argument at bad.file line 12.

</XMP>
<p>Although the error message above refers to the second tie statement in
the script, the source of the problem is really with the untie
statement that precedes it.
<p>To understand why there is a problem at all with the untie statement,
consider what the tie does for a moment. 
<p>Whenever the tie is executed, it creates a logical link between a Perl
variable, the associative array <CODE><STRONG>%x</STRONG></CODE> in this case, and a Berkeley DB
database, <CODE>tst.fil</CODE>. The logical link ensures that all operation on
the associative array are automatically mirrored to the database file.
<p>In normal circumstances the untie is enough to break the logical link
and also close the database. In this particular case there is another
logical link, namely the API object returned from the tie and stored in
<CODE><STRONG>$X</STRONG></CODE>. Whenever the untie is executed in this case, only the link
between the associative array and the database will be broken. The API
object in <CODE><STRONG>$X</STRONG></CODE> is still valid, so the database will not be closed.
<p>The end result of this is that when the second tie is executed, the
database will be in an inconsistent state (i.e. it is still opened by
the first tie) - thus the second tie will fail.
<p>If the <CODE>use strict 'untie'</CODE> pragma is included in the script, like
this:
<p>
<XMP>
    use DB_File ;
    use Fcntl ;
    use strict 'untie' ;
 
    $X = tie %x, 'DB_File', 'tst.fil' , O_RDWR|O_CREAT
        or die "Cannot tie first time: $!" ;
 
    $x{123} = 456 ;
 
    untie %x ;
 
    $X = tie %x, 'DB_File', 'tst.fil' , O_RDWR|O_CREAT
        or die "Cannot tie second time: $!" ;

</XMP>
<p>then the error message becomes:
<p>
<XMP>
    Can't untie: 1 inner references still exist at bad.file line 11.

</XMP>
<p>which pinpoints the real problem. Finally the script can now be
modified to fix the original problem by destroying the API object
before the untie:
<p>
<XMP>
    ...
    $x{123} = 456 ;
    undef $X ;
    untie %x ;
 
    $X = tie %x, 'DB_File', 'tst.fil' , O_RDWR|O_CREAT
    ...

Sharing databases with C applications</A>
</H2>
There is no technical reason why a Berkeley DB database cannot be
shared by both a Perl and a C application.
<p>The vast majority of problems that are reported in this area boil down
to the fact that C strings are NULL terminated, whilst Perl strings are
not. 
<p>Here is a real example. Netscape 2.0 keeps a record of the locations you
visit along with the time you last visited them in a DB_HASH database.
This is usually stored in the file <EM>~/.netscape/history.db</EM>. The key
field in the database is the location string and the value field is the
time the location was last visited stored as a 4 byte binary value.
<p>If you haven't already guessed, the location string is stored with a
terminating NULL. This means you need to be careful when accessing the
database.
<p>Here is a snippet of code that is loosely based on Tom Christiansen's
<EM>ggh</EM> script (available from your nearest CPAN archive in
<EM>authors/id/TOMC/scripts/nshist.gz</EM>).
<p>

Why is there Perl source in my database?</A>
</H2>
If you look at the contents of a database file created by DB_File,
there can sometimes be part of a Perl script included in it.
<p>This happens because Berkeley DB uses dynamic memory to allocate
buffers which will subsequently be written to the database file. Being
dynamic, the memory could have been used for anything before DB
malloced it. As Berkeley DB doesn't clear the memory once it has been
allocated, the unused portions will contain random junk. In the case
where a Perl script gets written to the database, the random junk will
correspond to an area of dynamic memory that happened to be used during
the compilation of the script.
<p>Unless you don't like the possibility of there being part of your Perl
scripts embedded in a database file, this is nothing to worry about.

<H2> <EM>What does ``Bareword 'DB_File' not allowed'' mean? </EM></H2>
You will encounter this particular error message when you have the
<CODE>strict 'subs'</CODE> pragma (or the full strict pragma) in your script.
Consider this script:
<p>
<XMP>
    use strict ;
    use DB_File ;
    use vars qw(%x) ;
    tie %x, DB_File, "filename" ;

</XMP>
<p>Running it produces the error in question:
<p>
<XMP>
    Bareword "DB_File" not allowed while "strict subs" in use 

</XMP>
<p>To get around the error, place the word <CODE>DB_File</CODE> in either single or
double quotes, like this:
<p>
<XMP>
    tie %x, "DB_File", "filename" ;

</XMP>
<p>Although it might seem like a real pain, it is really worth the effort
of having a <CODE>use strict</CODE> in all your scripts.

When <STRONG>DB_File</STRONG> is opening a database file it no longer terminates the
process if <EM>dbopen</EM> returned an error. This allows file protection
errors to be caught at run time. Thanks to Judith Grass

BUGS</A>

Some older versions of Berkeley DB had problems with fixed length
records using the RECNO file format. The newest version at the time of
writing was 1.85 - this seems to have fixed the problems with RECNO.
<p>I am sure there are bugs in the code. If you do find any, or can
suggest any enhancements, I would welcome your comments.
